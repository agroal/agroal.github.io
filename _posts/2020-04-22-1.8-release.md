# Release 1.8

The 1.8 version of Agroal adds support for a new pool interceptor mechanism, called AgroalPoolInterceptor, that provides access to the connection as it leaves and returns the pool. The design of this interface makes is consistent with transaction semantics and makes sure the connection is not made invalid to the pool. It can be seen as a higher level than the existing listener interface that is more target for integrations of Agroal.

This new release also adds several improvements on transaction recovery.
