The 1.6 version of Agroal adds a new pool implementation developed with [pgagroal](https://agroal.github.io/pgagroal/) in mind. 
This new pool is designed for scenarios where multiple Agroal pools share a common data source. 
Examples are service mesh deployments where services are short-lived and process one transaction.
