The just released Agroal 1.11 fixes a couple issues when running in XA mode.

## Bug
* [AG-165](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AG-165) - XAConnection.close is never called
* [AG-166](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AG-166) - Make sure hander state is always obtained through state updater
* [AG-167](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AG-167) - Prevent connection return after XA completion
* [AG-168](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AG-168) - Close connection wrappers on rollback without emitting a warning
