Agroal version 1.10, besides the usual bug fixes and improvements, brings some new features to improve correctness when using the pool.
The first of these features is a new setting to require that all connections are obtained in the context of a running transaction. 
For applications that do not run with a transaction manager, a new setting prevents a thread from trying to acquire multiple connections.
There were also enhancements to prevent applications crossing transaction boundaries while holding a connection. 
For those moments when all this safeties fail, there is now a possibility of collecting extra data and provide extra information on leak report.
