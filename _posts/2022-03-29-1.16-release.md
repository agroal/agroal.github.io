# Release 1.16

The 1.16 version of Agroal is a maintenance release that aims to improve the stability of the pool by fixing two issues reported by our community.
A new setting to the Connection Factory allows the login timeout to be specified, so that there is a limit to the amount of time it takes to establish a connection.

## Feature Request
* [AG-191](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AG-191) - Add loginTimeout to connection factory

## Bug
* [AG-189](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AG-189) - FlushOnClose causes "Closing connection in incorrect state" warnings
* [AG-190](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AG-190) - No acquisition timeout when unable to create new connection
