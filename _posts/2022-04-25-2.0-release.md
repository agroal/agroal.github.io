# Release 2.0

It's time for Agroal to make a step into the future! Starting with Agroal 2.0, there is a move to Jakarta EE APIs (the only area affected by the change is the transaction integration) and at the same time drop support for Java 8.

Because these are breaking changes, this release bumps the major version.

## Feature Request
* [AG-192](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AG-192) - Move to Jakarta EE APIs

## Task
* [AG-193](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AG-193) - Drop support for JDK 8
